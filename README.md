# Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder 🔐

A simple Python project to **encode** and **decode** text using the classic **Caesar Cipher** technique.  
This project demonstrates the basics of cryptography, string manipulation, and modular arithmetic in Python.

## 📖 What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques.  
It works by **shifting letters** of the alphabet by a fixed number (key).  
- Example with shift = 3:  
  - Plaintext: `HELLO`  
  - Ciphertext: `KHOOR`

---

## 🚀 Features
- Encode any text with a chosen shift value.
- Decode ciphertext back to plaintext.
- Handles both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters.
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
